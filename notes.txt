Concept
    - Voice chat, with regular input/output
    - Designed like MS teams, but just with AI in the middle
        - Display in the middle, represents AI's icon, changes (i.e., to code generation)
        - Simple prompts are to the side, act as transcripts between me and the AI

Side bar:
    - Main AI
    - French learning AI
    - Day Trading AI (paper trading -> to real with api)
    - Songs?
